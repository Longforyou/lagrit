        <h2>LaGriT Registration</h2>
        <p>Supported  platforms are <strong>Mac OSX (Intel only) and Linux</strong>.<strong> Windows</strong> distribution will be available soon. An exacutible is distributed that does not require compiling or building. </p>
        <p>If you obtain the source code for your own user modules, it is suggested that you compile it with gfortran and gcc Versions 4.5 or greater. If you use another compiler and have problems, we will not be able to help.</p>
        <p>LaGriT now supports ExodusII file format output (which sits on top of netCDF). If you want to compile your own code, you have to build the ExodusII and netCDF libraries yourself. We do not distribute those packages. Contact Greg Sjaardema at Sandia National Laboratories (gdsjaar @ sandia.gov):</p>
