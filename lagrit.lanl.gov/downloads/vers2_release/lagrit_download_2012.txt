Feel free to send email if you have questions. Let me know if you have
any problems or would like assistance getting started.

General documentation for LaGriT can be found at the URL:
http://lagrit.lanl.gov
Documentation for each LaGriT module can be found at the URL:
http://lagrit.lanl.gov/manual.shtml
Some examples and project archives can be found in:
http://meshing.lanl.gov/proj

If you have any publications, presentations or web pages that illustrate
the application you are working on, I would appreciate it if you would
send me citations, URL's or copies of the work.

FTP Site and commands for LaGriT download:
ftp ftp.lanl.gov
login: anonymous
password: your email address
cd /public/gable/lagrit
get lagrit_YOUR_OS_o (where YOUR_OS is either lin, mac, sun, etc.)
quit
chmod +x lagrit_YOUR_OS_o

There are optimized versions of LaGriT (recommended):
Linux:                     lagrit_lin_o
Mac OS X (Intel chip):     lagrit_maci_o
Mac OS X:(non-Intel chip): lagrit_mac_o
Solaris:                   lagrit_sun_o
SGI_32bit:                 lagrit_sgi32_o

There are debugger versions of LaGriT (for developers/advanced users):
Linux:                     lagrit_lin_g
Mac OS X (Intel chip):     lagrit_maci_g
Mac OS X (non-Intel chip): lagrit_mac_g
Solaris:                   lagrit_sun_g
SGI_32bit:                 lagrit_sgi32_g

There are also libraries available but they are only necessary if you
plan to write your own modules. They are on the FTP site and you are
welcome to download.

The graphics/code output formats that are normally used are:
ParaView - (free)       http://www.paraview.org

GMV -      (commercial) http://laws.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/GMVHome.html
AVS -      (commercial) http://www.avs.com
Tecplot -  (commercial) http://www.tecplot.com

These are not related to LaGriT and may be obtained from their
respective sources.

For demos and examples see:
http://meshing.lanl.gov/proj
Also, a simple demo input file is attached.

To run LaGriT just type: lagrit_YOUR_OS_o
and enter commands from the command line. For example at the first command prompt
you can type: infile demo.lgi
To run in background from a LaGriT control file type:
lagrit_YOUR_OS_o<                                  demo.lgi
LaGriT modules can also be called from within a Fortran/C program. See
documentation.

Feel free to send email if you have questions.
Let me know if you have any problems or would like any
assistance.

Cheers,
