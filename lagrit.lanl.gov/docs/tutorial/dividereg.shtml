        <h4><b>4. <U>Divide the enclosing volumes
          into regions</U></b> </h4>
        <DIR> <p>The<a href="../commands/REGION.html"> <b>region</b></a> command is used to divide the enclosing volume into regions.
        The directional operators <b>lt</b>, <b>le</b>,<b> gt</b>,<b> </b>and <b>ge </b>are applied to previously defined surfaces according to the following
        rules.</p><DIR>
        <p><b>lt -- </b>if the surface following
          is a volume then <b>lt </b>means inside not including the surface of the
          volume. If the surface is a plane or a sheet <b>lt </b>means the space
          on the side of the plane or sheet opposite to the normal not including
          the plane or sheet itself.</p>
        <p><b>le -- </b>if the surface following
          is a volume then <b>le</b> means inside including the surface of the volume.
          If the surface is a plane or a sheet <b>le </b>means the space on the side
          of the plane or sheet opposite to the normal including the plane or sheet
          itself. </p>
        <p><b>gt -- </b>if the surface following
          is a volume then <b>gt</b> means outside not including the surface of the
          volume. If the surface is a plane or a sheet <b>gt</b> means the space
          on the same side of the plane or sheet as the normal not including the
          plane or sheet itself. </p>
        <p><b>ge -- </b>if the surface following
          is a volume then <b>ge</b> means outside including the surface of the volume.
          If the surface is a plane or a sheet <b>ge</b> means the space on the same
          side of the plane or sheet as the normal including the plane or sheet itself. </p>
        </DIR>
        <p>In region comands, surface names must
          be preceeded by a directional operator. The logical operators <b>or</b>, <b>and</b>, and <b>not</b> mean union, intersection and complement respectively.
          Parentheses are operators and are used for nesting. Spaces are required
          as delimiters to separate operators and operands. To define the two regions
          created by the plane bisecting the unit cube:</p>
        <DIR>
        <pre><b>region</b>/top/ <b>le</b> cube <b>and</b> <b>gt</b> cutplane / <b>region</b>/bottom<b> /
        le</b> cube <b>and le </b>cutplane <b>/</b> </pre>
        </DIR>
        <p>The region <i>bottom </i>contains the
          interface <i>cutplane</i>; top contains none of the interface. Interior
          interfaces must be included in one and only one region.
          If a region touches an external
          boundary, include the surface that defines the enclosing volume in region
          and mregion commands. For example, the regions <i>top</i> and <i>bottom</i> are enclosed by the surface <i>cube</i></p>
